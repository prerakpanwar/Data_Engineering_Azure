Masters Project + Presentation for Big Data Analytics Subject (CIS602).
The Project Architecture is shown in the above picture.

Learning outcomes:
- Choosing a Storage account as per the requirement (Container for Blob Storage) (Data Lake Gen 2). 
- Building a pipeline (Using Data Factories).
- Data Transformation (Data Bricks)
- Data Analytics and visualizations (Synapse Analytics and PowerBI)
- Azure services like : App registrations, Cost Management + Billing, Resource Groups

Transformation code: Code_for_simple_transformation_on_databricks.ipynb

I used Power BI's free version that is why I was not able to connect it directly with Azure Synapse Analytics,
so I simply loaded the transformed CSV files and visualized them.
